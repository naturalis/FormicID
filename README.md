## Status

<!-- travis-ci -->

## Description
Code repository for CNN-based image classification of AntWeb images <br>
_FormicID is Formicidae / IDentification_

### AntWeb
AntWeb is the world's largest online database of images, specimen records, and natural history information on ants. It is community driven and open to contribution from anyone with specimen records, natural history comments, or images.<br>
<br>
Our mission is to publish for the scientific community high quality images of all the world's ant species. AntWeb provides tools for submitting images, specimen records, annotating species pages, and managing regional species lists.<br> <br>

### AntWeb API
* [AntWeb API version 2](https://www.antweb.org/api/v2/)
* [AntWeb API version 3 beta](https://www.antweb.org/documentation/api/apiV3.jsp)

At this moment version 2 is used because version 3 was not released when the project started. Version 3 is also still in beta. Later, the scripts will be changed to use version 3.
