Research Aim
--- 
- Paving the way / start the ball rolling on insect image classification
- 3 types of shots per image classification (sort of 3D image classification is rather new)

Questions 
---
- 3 shot types better than one?
- which shot type is better for classification?
- can we classify winged / non-winged?
- can we classify m / aQ/ dQ/ w
- How well will the neural network perform
- Parameter tuning - which parameters will be the best


Potiental problems
---
- Wrong AntWeb identifications
- aQ and dQ
- ergatoid?
- morphospecies (choose e.g. top 100 most imaged species?)
- specimens in amber resin?
- image quality?
